# ResQme-App

ResQme-App is a mobile application designed to simplify the pet adoption process. It's currently under active development.

## Objective

The primary objective of ResQme-App is to connect potential pet adopters with pets that need a home. The app provides a user-friendly interface where users can view a list of pets available for adoption, along with detailed information about each pet. Users can also post pets for adoption, and update or delete their posts as needed.

## Technology

ResQme-App is built using a variety of modern technologies:

- **React Native**: A popular framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React.
- **Expo**: An open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.
- **Supabase**: An open source Firebase alternative. We use Supabase for user authentication and to store pet information.
- **React Navigation**: Used for routing and navigation in the app.
- **Expo Image Picker**: A module that allows the user to pick an image from the device's gallery.
- **Expo File System**: Provides access to a device's file system. It's used in this app to read image data.

## Future Plans

I am constantly working to improve ResQme-App and add new features. Stay tuned for updates!
